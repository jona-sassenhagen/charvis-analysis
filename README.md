# This is my README

# This repository contains the scripts required to analyse a 
# neuropsychological experiment, code-named "Charvis", that 
# is intended to uncover the alignment of the P600 component. 
# The scripts are for MATLAB and all require EEGLAB; one also 
# requires ERPLAB. MATLAB is expensive, but widely available,
# and EEGLAB/ERPLAB are GPL'd and can be downloaded at 
# sccn.ucsd.edu/eeglab/â€Ž .

# The data these scripts are intended for has not been collected 
# so far. A manuscript describing the hypotheses behind this 
# experiment, and the analyses these scripts are intended to perform,
# has been submitted as a Registered Report to Cortex and is awaiting
# peer review and In Principle Acceptance. Raw data files these scripts
# can be applied to will be uploaded to and hosted by Elsevier at an 
# as of yet undisclosed location.

# You can find these files here because my coworker Phillip Alday has 
# proposed how a version control system tracking experimental analysis 
# scripts can further improve scientific standards. You can find a 
# discussion of the idea here: http://bit.ly/106JtXJ

# This repo contains a number of files. Generally, you first have to preprocess
# files using charvis-prep. Then, you can use either of the other files to 
# generate one of the measures, like ERPimages or ERPimage-derived statistics,
# or even regular ERPs if you feel so inclined.
# None of the scripts are assumed to be especially optimised.
